    <h5>Tips for managing stress:</h5>
    <p style="font-size: 18px">
      <ol style="font-size: 18px">
        <li>Ask yourself what you can do about the sources of your stress. Think through the pros and cons. Take action where you can.</li>
        <li>Keep a positive, realistic attitude. Accept that although you can't control certain things, you're in charge of how you respond.</li>
        <li>Stand up for yourself in a polite way. Share your feelings, opinions, or beliefs, instead of becoming angry, defensive, or passive.</li>
        <li>Learn and practice relaxation techniques. Try breathing exercises, meditation, prayer, yoga, or tai chi.</li>
        <li>Exercise regularly. You'll feel better and be more prepared to handle problems.</li>
        <li>Eat healthy. Avoid too much sugar. Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. When you're stressed, you'll probably want less-nutritious comfort foods, but if you overdo them, they'll add to your problems.</li>
        <li>Try to manage your time wisely.</li>
        <li>Say no, where you can, to things that would add more stress to your life.</li>
        <li>Make time for hobbies and interests.</li>
        <li>Get enough rest and sleep. Your body needs time to recover from stressful events.</li>
        <li>Don't rely on alcohol, drugs, or food to help against stress. Ease up on caffeine, too.</li>
        <li>Spend time with people you love.</li>
        <li>Talk with a counselor or take a stress management class for more help.</li>
      </ol>

    <h5>Time management methods:</h5>
    <p style="font-size: 18px">
      Technique #1: Make and use lists. - Make some schedules, some to-do-lists, plan everything out so you can get everything you need done.<br>
      Technique #2: Minimize meetings. - let’s be honest. No one works at meetings. If it can be done alone, it should probably be done alone.<br>
      Technique #3: Block your time.  - tying back to making lists, allocate your time to certain activities so you can be as efficient as possible<br>
      Technique #4: Profit from free time. - use your free time efficiently,  there are tons of small things to do when sitting on the bus, or waiting in a reception office. Don’t waste your time.<br>
      Technique #5: Pomodoro Technique - “The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.”
